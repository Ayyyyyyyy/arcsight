## On heavy connectors, check the 'agent.log' for the following entry: "File queue now dropping events"         \
## Dropping of events can occure on both sides - however there is only a notification/audit event in arcsight,  \
## if events get dropped on the output side (3) and  arcsight is not telling us about dropping on the incoming  \
## side (2) via audit events.
