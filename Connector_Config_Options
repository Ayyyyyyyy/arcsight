## Faster cache clearing
## NOTE: if you are noticing that your syslog Connector seems to be 'up but not doing anything' and has a cache, don't panic and \
## act on that by trying to stop and start it again as it will only simply try to validate the cache count on each restart. If   \
## truly want the Connector up ASAP and are carrying cache backlogs then this property will help.
